atomas game
max 18
19 - dÃ¸d

game:
every move{
	have a random(dont know random[1]) number in hand
	may get super	
	insert the random between 2 elements in the array
	move both to the sides(or 1)
	
	for all +supers
		if both sides of super are equal
			get both sides
			super = max(side, super) +1
			destroy both sides
			get points for these
	
	if arraylength(atoms) > 18
		game end
}

[1] game may get quadratically harder(whithout space)

make the game play itself, random insert numbers, get score.
[make nodes] know where to place, communicate with right atoms

make calculations of every place

points are how many you get on the board before you die. 
atom number is independent of score
